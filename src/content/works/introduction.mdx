## Introduction

I wanted a place to share my thoughts, like a journal but not as private. Living on social media since 2008 or so, I see a lot of people who share extremely opinionated views on various subjects. What confidence! While I'm not as sure of myself as others might be of themselves, I figured what the hell? So I set about creating this site. It's sole purpose is to be the side of me the professional realm doesn't see. -The unprofessional side.

## Self-Awareness

It's not like I don't already bother other people with these things, anyway. Habibi hears this shit every day. 10.. no, 20 minute rants (sometimes a half hour or more) about various topics. I always feel guilty blowing up his phone with things that he could probably give a shit about (love you, Habibi!), but I feel comfortable there and it just sorta comes out.

Being on the spectrum has something to do with the vulnerability, I think. We're always weighing what we say, sometimes regretting it later. You ever lay in bed at night thinking to yourself, "Why the fuck did I say that shit? I bet they're all laughing at me right now." until you pass out? That's me. A lot. I need a space where I can just be me. Sometimes intellectual, sometimes an idiot, sometimes just pure word vomit.

I'm very self-aware on this. I know not everything I say is important, but all the same, the catharsis is important to me.

## Understanding

My intentions, above all, are to facilitate understanding. Who knows if anyone would ever agree with me on Climate Change or Socialism? How many Muslims are going to be reading this? I don't know. Important thing is that I'm okay if we disagree on whatever fundamental principle lay between us; but understanding what others feel and think on particular subjects, especially the controversial ones, can be valuable in and of itself.

## Conclusion

So, in closing, my goal here is to share the personal side of me. The beliefs, the opinions, the fundamentals of what makes me me. We can disagree, in fact, I encourage it. So long as you can gain insight into what someone who differs from you thinks and feels in an educational way. If we can all be vulnerable and learn something at the same time, we can affect change.

Stay dangerous.
