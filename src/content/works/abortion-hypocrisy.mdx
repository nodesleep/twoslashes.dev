## Introduction

In the realm of political and social discourse, few debates are as fervently argued as the issue of abortion. The pro-life movement positions itself as the guardian of life, advocating for the sanctity of the unborn with a zeal often wrapped in moral and religious rhetoric. However, a deeper examination reveals a tapestry of contradictions that challenge the sincerity of their proclaimed empathy.

This article delves into the hypocrisy of abortion bans, highlighting the stark disconnect between the movement's avowed commitment to life and their support for policies and actions that harm or neglect children in other contexts. From endorsing military actions in conflict zones that result in child casualties (even celebrating the fact) to opposing welfare programs that would alleviate child hunger, and from undermining education quality to enforcing religious dogma over genuine compassion; this piece exposes a narrative not of life preservation but of a selective moral outrage.

Here, we will explore how what is presented as a fight for life might actually be a mask for enforcing a particular religious and ideological viewpoint, questioning the authenticy of the "pro-life" stance when it comes to the welfare of all children.

## Support For Military Actions In Conflict Zones

The pro-life movement often cloaks itself in the banner of life's sanctity, yet this very sanctity seems to dissipate when it comes to the consequences of military actions supported by some of its proponents.

A poignant example can be found in the ongoing conflict in Palestine, where schools; supposed sanctuaries of childhood and learning, have become targets. Certain pro-life advocates, who voice vehement opposition to abortion, show a perplexing indifference or even support for these military actions. Despite the fact that the enemy has never been found hiding in schools. They support policies that lead to civilian casualties, including these children in their educational environments. The contradiction is glaring: how can one claim to defend the life of the unborn while endorsing or ignoring the bombing of places where children gather to learn and grow?

Seems a bit like, "If they're unborn, they should be protected. Once they're born, however, fuck 'em."

The financial backing of wars (I could easily write another article about this topic alone), where child casualties are an almost inevitable outcome, further underscores this hypocrisy. The U.S. has seen political figures known for their pro-life stances also support military budgets and interventions that result in significant civilian harm, particularly among children. This support for policies that lead to the death of children in conflict zones stands in stark opposition to the moral crusade against abortion. It raises questions about whether the protection of life is truly the guiding principle, or if it's selectively applied based on geopolitical interests or ideological alignments rather than a consistent ethic of life.

In both scenarios, the disconnect between rhetoric and action is evident. While advocating for the protection of the fetus, there's a noticeable absence of outcry or action against policies that harm living, breathing children in war-torn regions; harmed by the very funding and military support such individuals were all too eager to provide. This selective empathy suggests that for some, the pro-life stance is more about enforcing a particular worldview or religious doctrine than genuinely safeguarding human life in all its stages.

## Stance On Welfare and Child Hunger

The rhetoric of protecting life from conception should logically extend to the well-being of children once they are born, yet this is where another layer of hypocrisy in the pro-life movement becomes apparent.

Many in the pro-life community advocate against government welfare programs like SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), which aim to combat child hunger and poverty. The argument often revolves around personal responsibility and the reduction of government dependency. However, this stance directly contradicts the proclaimed pro-life ethos when it results in children facing malnutrition or hunger. If life is truly sacred, why does the support for these children diminish once they are outside the womb? The refusal to back policies that would provide basic necessities for children born into poverty undermines the integrity of the pro-life movement's life-affirming narrative.

This hypocrisy extends to broader economic policies favored by some pro-life advocates, particularly those that advocate for tax cuts for the wealthy or reductions in social spending. Such policies can lead to decreased funding for programs that directly affect child welfare, like education, healthcare, and food assistance. By supporting or not challenging these policies, the movement inadvertently contributes to environments where children's health and development are compromised, contrasting sharply with their stance on protecting life at all costs.

The lack of advocacy for policies that would ensure children have the resources they need to thrive after birth speaks volumes. It suggests that for some, the pro-life stance is more about controlling women's reproductive choices than about a holistic commitment to life. This selective application of life's sanctity illuminates a gap between rhetoric and action; it's not about ensuring all lives flourish but rather about enforcing a moral code that does not extend to the practical, tangible support of children in need.

## Education Policies

The commitment to life should ideally encompass the nurturing of young minds through education, yet here too, the pro-life movement's actions often misalign with their proclaimed values.

There's a notable trend among some pro-life advocates to support policies that either defund public education or push for privatization, which can lead to significant disparities in educational quality and access. This approach tends to benefit those who can afford private education while leaving public school systems, where many disadvantaged children are educated, under-resourced and underperforming. How can a movement that champions life turn its back on policies that would ensure all children have the opportunity for a decent education? The contradiction here is that while they advocate for life before birth, they often do not fight for the life-enhancing benefits of quality education post-birth.

Furthermore, the push for religious education or the inclusion of religious teachings in public schools by some within this movement can be seen as an attempt to indoctrinate rather than educate. This focus on religious doctrine over comprehensive educational welfare can marginalize students from different or no religious backgrounds and often does not address the broad educational needs of all children. Instead of promoting a curriculum that prepares children for diverse life challenges, some advocate for one that prioritizes religious conformity, which might not serve the best interest of all children in terms of personal development, critical thinking, and societal contribution.

The pro-life movement's stance on education reveals a preference for ideological control over fostering an environment where every child can thrive intellectually and morally. By supporting policies that might not universally benefit all children or by prioritizing religious teachings over broad, inclusive education, they expose a selective concern for life that ends once the child is born. This section of the argument points to the need for consistency; if life is sacred, then ensuring that life has the foundation to succeed through education should be a non-negotiable part of that sanctity.

## The Underlying Motives

The crux of the pro-life movement's hypocrisy lies in the discrepancy between their proclaimed empathy for life and the actual motives driving their policies, which appear more aligned with enforcing religious dogma than with genuine compassion.

The movement often presents itself as the moral compass of society, claiming to act out of empathy for the unborn. However, this empathy seems selective; it's fervently applied to the fetus but wanes when it comes to the living, suffering child, particularly if their existence challenges or complicates the narrative of moral purity. This selective empathy suggests that the movement's actions are less about human welfare and more about imposing a specific moral or religious framework on society.

The underpinning of much pro-life rhetoric is religious, often rooted in interpretations of scripture that prioritize certain life issues over others. This focus on religious doctrine can overshadow the broader humanistic principles of empathy, justice, and equality. When policies are shaped primarily by religious beliefs rather than by a comprehensive ethic of care for all people, the true intent of "pro-life" becomes questionable. It raises the point that the movement might be more about creating a society that conforms to a particular religious view than about saving lives in a universally compassionate manner.

## Conclusion

In dissecting the hypocrisy, we've unveiled a narrative where the sanctity of life is selectively applied. The pro-life movement's support for military actions that harm children, their opposition to welfare that would alleviate child hunger, their acceptance of policies leading to subpar education, and their prioritization of religious doctrine over comprehensive human welfare all paint a picture of contradiction.

This analysis does not argue against the moral considerations of abortion but challenges the integrity of a movement that claims to be pro-life yet neglects the living. If the true aim is to protect and nurture life at all stages, then the actions and policies supported should reflect this across the board, not just in the womb. The hypocrisy highlighted here suggests that for some within the movement, the fight is less about life and more about enforcing a particular moral, religious, or ideological stance.

In the end, the question remains; Is the movement truly about life, or is it about control under the guise of morality? Until this question is addressed with actions that consistently support life from birth to adulthood, the label "pro-life" will continue to be scrutinized for its sincerity.
