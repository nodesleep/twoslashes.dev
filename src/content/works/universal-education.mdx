Try to imagine a society where every individual, regardless of their background, could
attend college without the burdens of overwhelming debt. In several other nations around the
world, this is already a reality, yet here in the United States, this idea remains a fantasy for
millions. With student debt surpassing $1.5 trillion dollars and the cost of tuition continuing to
skyrocket, the time has come to reimagine higher education as a public good and one that is
accessible to all and funded by the society it serves. This idea is not only ethically justified, but
economically sound. Education should be free to students, and it should be financed through
public means. An educated population benefits all aspects of society.

A cornerstone of democracy has always been viewed in public education. Just as society
deemed it necessary to promote and provide K-12 education at no immediately visible direct cost
to students and taxpayers, the same logic should apply to undergraduate and post-graduate
studies. College funded by the public is not a new concept, with countries like Germany,
Norway, and Finland implementing such systems with measurable success. These nations have
demonstrated that when higher education is regarded as a public service rather than a
commodity, workforce readiness improves and innovation blossoms. Unfortunately, the United
States views higher education as a personal investment without any regard for the societal
benefits, leaving individuals to carry the debt despite the broad advantages.

It is important that society understands education as a public good. Public goods are
characterized by their non-excludability and non-rivalrous consumption. This means that one
person’s use does not diminish another’s, and no one can be effectively excluded from its
benefits. We can find common examples in roads, national defense, or even clean air. Public
education also fits this mold. When people are educated, they contribute more effectively to their
communities, economies, and democratic institutions. They are statistically less likely to rely on
government aid and more likely to participate in civic life. In all, they’re better equipped to
tackle complex problems in society. UNESCO highlights this point by linking the increase in
education to more stable societies, citing reduced crime rates and lower instances of early
pregnancy as key benefits. It would make sense that investing in higher education is not merely
an act of generosity, but rather a sensible strategy for long term national wellbeing.

The return on investment in education is well documented. Data from the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows public institutions invest
approximately $20,500 annually per tertiary student. At first glance, this seems like a high figure,
but the long-term payoff is even greater. College grads earn significantly more over the span of
their lives that those with only a high school diploma, translating into increased tax revenues.
Educated individuals are less likely to experience unemployment, reducing the strain on
government safety nets. These outcomes benefit everyone equally, not just the individuals
earning their degrees. In fact, the broader the access to education, the greater the economic
benefit. Countries with tuition-free college systems tend to have higher levels of innovation and
economic competitiveness, which demonstrates that public investment in higher education yields
incredible returns.

Of course, the idea that taxpayers should fund education often meets a brick wall of
resistance from those who believe it is unfair to subsidize others’ schooling. This objection
overlooks the fundamental principle of collective investment in shared resources. A counter
argument to this is often one pointing out that most people do not use every public service they
helped to fund. A person may go their entire lives without calling the fire department. More
relevant, people without children are still contributing to the public school system in their area.
This is where the justification lies. An educated society reduces crime, increases the output of the
economy, and it enhances overall quality of life. Publicly funded education is the same. It is an
investment in the infrastructure of society and is no less vital than roads or emergency services.
Regardless of whether one is directly involved, there is mutual benefit to them for contributing to
higher education.

The GI Bill is a historical precedent which supports the value of taxpayer-funded
education. The GI Bill was passed to provide free college education to returning World War II
veterans. This policy did not solely help the individuals, it catalyzed a period of unprecedented
economic growth, which fueled the rise of a thriving middle class. Today we refer to that period
as the “baby boomer era”. Similar principles apply to society today. When states and local
municipalities invest in education, the local economy benefits through increased earnings, the
creation of business, and reduced reliance on public assistance. A case study conducted for the
Governor’s office of Illinois revealed that providing tuition-free community college led to
economic growth. This is a compelling case for implementation.

Switching lenses, incarceration rates offer a new view into the social impact of education.
Numerous studies have shown that education significantly reduces recidivism. Inmates who
participate in educational programs while incarcerated are 43% less likely to reoffend after
release. Some estimates place the reduction at up to 70 percent. This is a dramatic improvement
to public safety and a huge cost savings to the taxpayer. Every dollar invested in prison
education returns an estimated $4 to $5 in reduced incarceration costs within the first three years
after release (Department of Justice & Education, 2013; RAND Corporation, 2013). Such a
statistic illustrates that education is a powerful tool for both individual transformation and
systemic reform.

The case is strong, but it is also important to acknowledge potential challenges. Critics
point to concerns about cost, quality, and institutional overcrowding. These are valid issues, but
they are not impossible to overcome. Progressive funding models can be created, ensuring that
wealthy individuals contribute more to the system. Capacities can be scaled responsibly with
proper planning and investment. Quality can be maintained through accreditation standards and
performance-based funding mechanisms. The goal here is to create a system that is more
inclusive, efficient, and beneficial to society without creating barriers that prevent capable
students from pursuing higher education.

One of the biggest criticisms to date is that universal free college might lead to something
called “over-enrollment” or diminish the perceived value of a degree. Evidence from countries
with these tuition-free systems suggest otherwise. Enrollment increases are more than
manageable in these cases, and the respect for education has remained intact. When students are
not plagued with the debt of education, they are far more likely to obtain careers in public service
or research. They’re even more likely to go into fields that offer lower pay but contribute to
society on a significant level. This kind of flexibility offers solutions to problems like teacher
shortages and other areas like nursing positions or social work.

The mental health implications behind debt are severe. Students have put off buying a
house or starting families due to the burden of student loan debt. Students with an entrepreneurial
drive will delay starting a business, stagnating economic growth. The list goes on. Free education
stands to alleviate the burden of debt and grant a sense of personal freedom that promotes a
healthier society. With free education, students will make choices based on their dreams, not
their bank account.

Having a higher level of education also means an increased likelihood to vote in
elections. Volunteerism and community action are fostered by those with degrees. Both of these
activities strengthen democracy and promote a strong sense of community. In this day and age,
marked by polarizing politics and a growing distrust in institutions due to misinformation, access
to higher education could be a beacon of hope. Critical thinking and tolerance as well as the
ability to engage in informed discussions are indispensable skills.

Based on these facts, free education is not a radical departure from our core American
values. On the contrary, it reflects a core of opportunity, responsibility, and an investment in
progress. We recognize that the benefits of education extend well beyond the individual and the
health of our society depends largely on the education of its people. By funding higher
education, we invest in the potential of a future not limited by money.

There is nothing more relevant today than the need for a well-educated society. Free
college is not just an ideal or pipe dream, it’s a necessary step toward building a community that
values progress. With everything to gain, it becomes our civic duty to share the burden and
promote a brighter future.
