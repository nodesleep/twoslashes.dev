    <p>
      If you're a software engineer, web developer, or a nerd all the same;
      you'll know that two slashes signify a comment in code. While a lot of my
      writings here won't necessarily pertain to code (some of it will), my
      purpose for this site was to offer commentary. These are my comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a quiet corner of the internet where I share thoughts, ideas, and
      opinions that don't always fit into polite conversations or social media
      posts. It's not a portfolio, nor a professional statement; Just a
      collection of musings from someone who enjoys asking questions and
      challenging norms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to browse, reflect, or even disagree. Just know that what's
      written here isn't meant to persuade or provoke, only to explore and
      provide insight and facilitate understanding from a potentially differing
      viewpoint.
