Before I knew anything about these guidestones, I was told they were a "New World Order" conspiracy. Unironically, that was from a Christian who, by today's standards, would be considered an extremist. But at the time of my impressionable 
youth, I didn't know any better. I randomly remembered these stones and decided to do some research.

The stones served as a sundial, with a hole in the capstone marking the day's date at noon, and featured astronomical alignments. The four stones carried a series of inscriptions in various languages reading:

- Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
- Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity.
- Unite humanity with a living new language.
- Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason.
- Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
- Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
- Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
- Balance personal rights with social duties.
- Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite.
- Be not a cancer on the Earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature.

What sane person would disagree with this? Unfortunately, many religious extremists viewed the stones as "satanic" and eventually vandalized the stones. One fateful day, an unknown actor blew up one of the pillars, forcing the state of Georgia 
to remove the remains of the monument.

Today, mere record alone keeps them alive. I find their advice to be incredibly relevant to society today. "Be not a cancer on the Earth - Leave room for nature - Leave room for nature." - That alone should be the foundation of our education 
and our politics.
