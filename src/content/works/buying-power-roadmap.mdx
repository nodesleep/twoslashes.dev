# Abstract

This guide outlines a comprehensive, multi-phased strategy for restoring the buying power of the U.S. dollar (USD) to levels similar to those in the 1960's, a period when single-income families could thrive, housing was affordable, healthcare was trivial, and essential goods were considered within reach of most families. The plan emphasizes the need for systemic economic reforms that address the structural factors contributing to the erosion of the dollar, including inflation, wage stagnation, rising living costs, and economic inequality.

Key policy actions include controlling inflation and strengthening the dollar, reducing housing costs through increased supply and incentives for affordable housing, and enacting tax reforms to ensure fairer wealth distribution. The roadmap also advocates for significant investments in education, healthcare, and green energy, aiming to create new industries and job opportunities that provide higher wages in line with productivity. By focusing on sustainable economic growth, equitable distribution of resources, and stabilizing core sectors such as housing and healthcare, the roadmap seeks to rebuild the economic foundations that once allowed families to prosper on a single income.

This approach is designed to be implemented in stages, with initial efforts aimed at stabilizing the economy and addressing immediate cost of living concerns, followed by long-term investments in productivity, innovation, and social safety nets. Ultimately, the goal is to restore the balance between wages and the cost of living, ensuring that families have the economic freedom to thrive without excessive debt or financial insecurity.

This is a 10+ year plan.

# The 4-Phase Roadmap

## Phase 1: Stabilizing the Economy & Setting the Foundation (0-2 Years)

#### 1. Control Inflation and Strengthen the Dollar

Task the Federal Reserve with targeting moderate inflation rates (ideally under 2% annually) while focusing on stronger dollar policies. Implement stronger fiscal controls to curb deficit spending.

Inflation erodes buying power, so a stable currency is key. By keeping inflation in check and addressing natural debt, the value of the dollar will rise, giving consumers more purchasing power.

Timeframe: This should be enacted within the first year.

#### 2. Introduce Policies to Curb Housing Prices and Increase Affordability

Incentivize constructions of affordable housing through tax credits, subsidies, and easing zoning restrictions. Expand programs for low-interest housing loans.

Housing is the largest expense for most families. Making housing more affordable through increased supply and incentives can allow more families to own homes without excessive debt.

Timeframe: Immediately

#### 3. Reform the Tax System for Equity and Growth

Revise the income tax code to make it "progressive" (ensuring the wealthiest individuals and corporations pay a higher share). Introduce wealth taxes on assets above a certain threshold.

A fairer tax code would reduce inequality, provide more government revenue, and allow for the reinvestment into public goods like education and infrastructure.

Timeframe: 1-2 years

#### 4. Implement a Federal Healthcare Solution or Public Option

Create a truly universal healthcare system or a public option to reduce the financial burden of healthcare.

By cutting down healthcare costs, families have more disposable income. This also reduces personal bankruptcies cause by medical bills.

Timeframe: 1-2 years

## Phase 2: Investing in Long-Term Structural Reforms (2-5 Years)

#### 5. Promote Worker Productivity and Wage Growth

Invest in education and vocational training programs to upskill workers for higher paying jobs in growing sectors (green energy, tech, etc.). Encourage businesses to pay higher wages in exchange for tax incentives.

Raising wages in line with productivity ensures that workers get paid more for the value they bring. It also strengthens the middle class, leading to more spending power.

Timeframe: 2-3 years

#### 6. Encourage Innovation and New Industries

Invest in renewable energy and green technology. Create public-private partnerships to foster innovation in high-growth sectors.

Creating new, high-paying industries like green energy or AI can provide well-paid jobs to the workforce, which in turn drives economic growth and wage increases.

Timeframe: 2-3 years

#### 7. Implement Free or Low-Cost College Education

Implement tuition-free public universities or low-cost community college options. Provide increased federal funding for student grants and scholarships.

Making higher education more accessible without the burder of student debt allows people to enter better paying jobs and reduces the financial strain on families. As this is a polarized topic, implement measures to limit the amount of free use an individual has to ensure they can access the programs, but not abuse them.

Timeframe: 2-3 years to develop and implement regulations

#### 8. Address Corporate Markups and Encourage Fair Pricing

Introduce price regulation measures or tax incentives to prevent excessive corporate profit-taking on essential goods.

Corporations often mark up the price of goods and services significantly. By addressing this, essential goods like food, clothing, and household products could become more affordable.

Timeframe: 2-3 years to develop and implement regulations

## Phase 3: Building Economic Security and Support (5-10 Years)

#### 9. Strengthen Social Safety Nets

Expand childcare subsidies, implement paid family leave, and introduce a guaranteed income for families struggling to meet basic needs.

Strengthening social safety nets allows families to focus on long-term stability and savings without worrying about immediate survival. This also increases disposable income.

Timeframe: 5 years for gradual rollout

#### 10. Implement National Job Guarantee Program

Create a public sector jobs program that guarantees work for all who want it, particularly in infrastructure, green projects, and other vital services.

A job guarantee provides economic security, reduces unemployment, and ensures that everyone can contribute to the economy and prosper. Additionally, a requirement could be implemented that legislates all able-bodied adults either participate in voluntary employment or enter into the job guarantee program in order to receive benefits like healthcare and government assistance.

Timeframe: 5-7 years to scale

#### 11. Reform the Financial System to Promote Long-Term Investments

Encourage investment in long-term productive assets (green infrastructure, R&D, workforce training) rather than speculative financial products.

Reforming the financial system would reduce the prioritization of short-term profits and incentivize investments that benefit society as a whole, including wage growth, innovation, and infrastructure.

Timeframe: 5-10 years to transition incentives

## Phase 4: Securing the Future and Ensuring Sustainability (10+ Years)

#### 12. Ensure Sustainable Global Trade

Introduce fair trade policies that support domestic industries and workers while still encouraging global cooperation. Balance global trade with local industry growth.

Fair trade allows U.S. industries to grow while reducing the negative effects of globalization on wages and jobs. It also helps ensure that products remain affordable for American consumers.

Timeframe: Ongoing after previous policies have been implemented

#### 13. Focus on Long-Term Economic Equity

Create programs for economic equity that target specific groups (rural areas, marginalized communities) and ensure inclusive economic growth.

Promoting economic equity will ensure that all parts of the economy benefit from these reforms, ensuring a truly fair society where everyone prospers.

Timeframe: Ongoing after previous policies have been implemented

## Metrics of Success

To track the success of this plan, key performance indicators to focus on would be the following:

* Inflation rate at or below 2% per year.
* Median wages grow in line with productivity and inflation.
* Homeownership rate increases, with focus on first-time buyers.
* Measure the percentage of the population with affordable healthcare.
* Track the percentage of students graduating without debt or with minimal debt.
* Unemployment rate remains low and stable, while ensuring job quality.
* Childcare costs are within reach for working families, based on evaluated median income.
* Savings rates increase with positive growth trends as time elapses.

# Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear, actionable plan for policymakers who want to restore the buying power of the dollar to historic levels. It focuses on addressing the systemic issues that have made the cost of living rise disproportionately to wages, while also introducing measures to foster economic stability, innovation, and fairness.

Each phase builds upon the last, ensuring that long-term policies support the stability and prosperity of American families. The key challenge will be balancing immediate needs with long-term goals, but with strategic planning and commitment, this vision could be realized.
