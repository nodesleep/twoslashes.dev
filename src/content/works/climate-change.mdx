## Disclaimer

This isn't an article meant to sway people into thinking a certain way, though I hope that whatever you take from this is inspiring to you. I'm of the mindset that right or wrong, I have no control over the data as well as the need for global participation to mitigate any further detriment to the environment based on the data. I'm not here to argue that a potential exists, that an agenda exists/doesn't exist, or that certain sources should be trusted over others.

That's ultimately up to you to decide. This article is meant solely for the purpose of reflection regarding my personal decisions on the matter.
