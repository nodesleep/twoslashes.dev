## Reclaiming my body

I got tired of sitting around and loathing myself and what I've become. I decided to finally do something about it. You see, I'm one of the biggest "unfinished business" sort of guys you could ever meet. I do something, I lose interest, I revisit ten years later. Not this time.

For about a month and half now, I've been working out daily and counting my calories. I've lost 28lbs.

I don't intend to give up, either. I'm set on being healthy. I want to reclaim my body and be someone I can be proud of.

That's all. Happy new year 21 days late.
